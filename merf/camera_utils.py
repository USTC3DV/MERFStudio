    """Orients and centers the poses. We provide two methods for orientation: pca and up.

    pca: Orient the poses so that the principal directions of the camera centers are aligned
        with the axes, Z corresponding to the smallest principal component.
        This method works well when all of the cameras are in the same plane, for example when
        images are taken using a mobile robot.
    up: Orient the poses so that the average up vector is aligned with the z axis.
        This method works well when images are not at arbitrary angles.
    vertical: Orient the poses so that the Z 3D direction projects close to the
        y axis in images. This method works better if cameras are not all
        looking in the same 3D direction, which may happen in camera arrays or in LLFF.

    There are two centering methods:
    poses: The poses are centered around the origin.
    focus: The origin is set to the focus of attention of all cameras (the
        closest point to cameras optical axes). Recommended for inward-looking
        camera configurations.

    Args:
        poses: The poses to orient.
        method: The method to use for orientation.
        center_method: The method to use to center the poses.

    Returns:
        Tuple of the oriented poses and the transform matrix.
